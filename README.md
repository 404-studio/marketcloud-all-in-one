# Marketcloud all in one

This is the open source version of the discontinued backend as a service [marketcloud](http://www.marketcloud.it)

## Roadmap

The project still need polishing:


- The development stopped quite some time ago, so it was never converted to ES6+ javascript
- In-code documentation (aka comments) needs to be improved
- Dependencies must be updated as some NPM packages are outdated
- Integration tests are missing since old integration tests were built around our own deployment


## Getting started

Read our the [deployment documentation](https://github.com/Marketcloud/marketcloud-all-in-one/blob/master/deployment/README.md)
